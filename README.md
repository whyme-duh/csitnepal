# Study Notes Nepal 

I had a interest of building a website where students can find their notes for the respective subjects. This website is solely focused on CSIT students of Nepal only for now. As there are lots of websites that provide this type of sevices to the students. But I liked to make one for my own to learn and test my skills.

I built this website with Django framework and light front-end tools (CSS, HTML AND JS). 

The user can create their account but it is in basic state, though we can create account post a blogs and upload files for other students but it is not feasible and secured. The main focus of this website right now is to provide resources only.
